This repository is for the Module 4 Challenge

Found that the clients that had the most entries didn't necessarily translate 
to those that had the highest $$ value.

Client 24741 had the highest quantity of items purchased (and profit), but was the last of the
top five when it came to the number of entries.

Likewise, client 33615 had the highest number of entries in the data, but came in 
last of the top five for items purchased, and overall profitability.
